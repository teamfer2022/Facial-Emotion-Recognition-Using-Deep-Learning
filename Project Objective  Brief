The main aim of this project is to produce Automatic Facial Expression Recognition System using deep learning Techniques 
like which can take human facial images having some expressions as input and detect to successfully classify
it to accurate expression among the seven different expression classes .We have used techniques like neural networks , 
Machine learning ,transfer learning .we have ran pre-trained model like MobileNetV2 , Deep neural network model , 
artificial neural network ,and a ML model Support Vector Machine. We managed to successfully create a live demonstration 
for prediction expressions of a human face.

Many different Deep Learning Neural Network models like Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) , Artificial Neural Netwo4rk (ANN),
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Machine Learning Model like Support Vector Machine (SVM) are used to solve this mult-label classification problem.


Haar cascade was the face detection concept used , many image processing steps like Image resizing, normalisation, cropping, data balancing was done to remove the issues 
related to the dataset and dataset with 28k images extracted from kaggle platform was altered with respect to the models and compatibility of the laptop used for implemneting them
and models were build & to make the live demo work too.
